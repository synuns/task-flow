# Final QA Evidence

Requirement/Journey: `SYS-02`, `SYS-04`, assignment-wide cross-journey review
Branch/Scope: `fix/dec-prefix`; full-gate commit `8a09746`; `main...HEAD`
Review date: 2026-08-31
Precondition: all four journey evidence records exist; no tracked primary human approval
record was found, so every checkpoint remains unapproved
Actions: compare the branch diff with the original requirement and OpenAPI; inspect auth,
router, delete, query-cache and mock boundaries; run color-literal, forbidden-import,
raw-fetch, production-storage, navigation-owner, secret, debug-output, generated-noise
and `git diff --check` scans; map every OpenAPI operation/status/schema to shared API and
MSW handlers; run the repository full gate on the intended branch state
Expected: semantic color tokens cover application colors; every required API operation
has an OAS-conforming submitted MSW implementation; auth and delete decisions remain
bounded by their approved policies; no cross-journey stale-state, architecture, secret,
debug or unrelated-diff finding remains
Actual: global application colors resolve through named CSS custom properties and the
feature code introduces no color literal; generated OpenAPI types remain consumed only
inside `shared/api`; sign-in, refresh, user, dashboard, task list/detail/delete handlers
cover all seven OpenAPI operations and their documented 200/400/401/404 shapes; protected
requests use the injected bearer client; mock-only session storage is isolated under
`src/mocks`; static boundary and diff scans passed
Console/Network: the four journey records account for the expected anonymous bootstrap
401, credential 400 and deliberate deleted-detail 404; no unexpected console or page
error remained; exact protected request counts and bearer headers are recorded per
journey
Screenshot/Trace: the four journey evidence files reference their Chromium attachments
and manual screenshots at desktop and applicable 390x844 mobile viewports
Finding: `DOCUMENTATION` — three approved and implemented `DEC-*` items, final `SYS-02`
and `SYS-04`, the phase summary, and checkpoint verdict wording retained stale pre-review
states; `TEST` — work-overview used a partial accessible-name locator and inspected the
request sequence before the returned dashboard finished rendering
Correction: set the three decision items and two supported system requirements to
`AI_VERIFIED`, use exact global-navigation names, await the returned dashboard heading,
and assert its legitimate bearer reload
Rerun verdict: focused work-overview Chromium rerun passed three consecutive parallel
cases; clean `./scripts/verify full` passed on `8a09746` — setup 79 tests, format, lint,
generated API check, TypeScript, 33 Vitest files/118 tests, production build, and five
Chromium core cases across all four journeys

Independent review status: the prior cross-Journey review narrative has no reviewer or
exact target commit record, so it is not accepted as the required independent review.
No historical reviewer or target was added retroactively.

## Scenario Loop Harness Independent Review — 2026-09-01

Review target: `9cabebf343fed5ab1c82f7432ce1134e4d1ac157`,
`QA-HARNESS-01`, and the five scenario-loop harness findings
Reviewer: `/root/harness_independent_review`, a fresh read-only context that did not
author the implementation
Checks: inspected `6931c91..9cabebf` and the correction diff, auth fixture/MSW cookie
boundary, three protected Journey specs, Playwright/Vitest config, TODO parser/tests,
`TODO.md`, and all five evidence files; ran `tests/test_verify_contract.py`, the harness
config Vitest, protected Journey Playwright tests, `./scripts/verify full`,
`git diff --check`, and `git status --short`
Findings: the first review of `e01c9c2` found three MEDIUM findings — JavaScript-readable
wide-path fixture cookie, TODO parser negative/English/Status gaps, and loss of semantic
fresh-server config coverage. The final review of `9cabebf` found none.
Corrections: seeded the existing MSW cookie store with an HttpOnly `/api/refresh` cookie
and asserted no document token; added missing-Status and Korean/English approval-claim
boundaries; restored semantic config imports and `reuseExistingServer: false` assertion
Rerun: verifier contract 12/12, harness config 2/2, protected Journey 3/3, hook 86,
Vitest 34 files/122 tests, build, core Chromium 5, verifier regression 19, diff check and
clean status all PASS
Verdict: PASS

## Human-owned remainder

`SYS-05` remains `IN_PROGRESS`: `AI_USAGE.md` contains the required sections, but its
four human-verification checkboxes are intentionally unchecked and a legacy pre-policy
record is explicitly marked as awaiting human review. No AI record was reviewed or
published by the agent. Final acceptance therefore remains a human action after the
full automatic gate.
