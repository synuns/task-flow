# AI Development Workflow

## Operating Loop

1. Select requirement IDs and acceptance conditions from `requirements.md`.
2. Classify risk and choose one independently testable unit.
3. Implement the smallest change and its appropriate automated test.
4. Run `./scripts/verify quick`.
5. Run applicable browser checks and record evidence.
6. Classify failures, correct root cause, and rerun the failed gate.
7. Record evidence and continue low-risk work.
8. At a completed golden journey, run lightweight adversarial review and ask
   for one human checkpoint acceptance.
9. After all journeys, run full adversarial review, `./scripts/verify full`,
   and final QA.
10. Ask a person for final acceptance. AI never declares human acceptance.

One work unit covers one requirement ID or one independently testable condition
inside an ID. Do not split work by file when files form one testable behavior.

## Risk and Authority

### LOW — AI proceeds continuously

Examples: approved-pattern implementation, focused tests, local unambiguous
fixes, active-task documentation, and necessary non-semantic cleanup.

AI may implement, test, diagnose, fix, review, commit, and continue. Record
requirement IDs, commands, browser evidence when applicable, and decisions.

### MEDIUM — human owns journey checkpoint

Examples: completing a golden journey, introducing a new interaction pattern,
or spanning routes, API state, and views within approved architecture.

AI completes and verifies a coherent batch, runs lightweight adversarial
review, then requests one checkpoint acceptance. Do not request approval for
each requirement inside the batch.

### HIGH — human decides before consequential change

Examples: conflicting requirements, authentication or security policy,
destructive-data semantics, dependency or architecture changes, scope
expansion, acceptance changes, and bypassing a failed gate.

Stop before the consequential implementation. Present evidence, options,
trade-offs, and recommendation. While waiting, continue only evidence work,
diagnosis, or unrelated LOW work that cannot cross the affected boundary.

AI proposes risk and owns execution evidence. People own journey acceptance,
HIGH decisions, exceptions, and final acceptance.

## Failure Classification

Assign one primary class and record evidence, rationale, corrective change, and
rerun result:

- `REQUIREMENT`: ambiguous, conflicting, missing, or misunderstood condition.
- `IMPLEMENTATION`: logic, state, or rendering defect.
- `INTEGRATION`: API, auth, routing, browser, or cross-module defect.
- `UX_ACCESSIBILITY`: usability, interaction, visual, or accessibility defect.
- `TEST`: incorrect, duplicate, flaky, or overly broad test.
- `ENVIRONMENT`: runtime, OS, browser, port, or local service problem.
- `TOOLING`: build, lint, typecheck, verify, hook, or runner problem.

`REQUIREMENT` and behavior-changing corrections are HIGH. Never turn a failure
green by weakening an assertion, adding an undocumented skip, or editing only
checklist status.

## Browser Failure Record

Browser-tool failure is not product success. Classify it as `ENVIRONMENT` or
`TOOLING`, restore trustworthy evidence, then rerun.

## Adversarial Review

After each of `auth-entry`, `work-overview`, `task-discovery`, and
`task-resolution`, use a fresh reviewer context or explicit second-pass role
that did not author the final change. Check requirement omissions, negative
paths, invariants, accessibility, weak or duplicate tests, console/network
errors, and missing evidence. Resolve findings before requesting checkpoint
acceptance.

After all checkpoints, perform a full review across journeys: auth transitions,
navigation, stale state, API errors, regression risk, OAS/mock consistency,
test duplication, and assignment-wide constraints.

## Human Checkpoints

Request human action only for:

- A completed golden journey after evidence and lightweight review.
- A HIGH-risk decision before consequential implementation.
- An exception to a required gate.
- Final QA readiness and final completion.

While a checkpoint is pending, evidence preparation and unrelated LOW analysis
may continue. Do not implement beyond the unapproved journey boundary.

For the `auth-entry` checkpoint, the person reviews focused integration
evidence that a protected request uses `Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>`
and that the approved refresh/expiry path was exercised. Add core browser
evidence only for credential or network behavior that the integration boundary
cannot prove; a visible profile action alone is not authentication evidence.

## Prompt Records

Tool stop hooks may create redacted candidates only. Candidates are not
submission evidence. A person reviews the exact candidate bytes and sensitive
information, computes their reviewed SHA-256 digest, then supplies that digest
and both explicit confirmations to the publication command. The publisher
opens the candidate through a no-follow descriptor, requires a regular file,
reads it once, and publishes only the bytes matching the digest. Under the
shared index lock it regenerates the entire managed `AI_USAGE.md` region from
the post-publication canonical reviewed index, removing stale or malformed
entries and restoring missing links while excluding unindexed artifacts. AI
must not invoke that command or mark review complete on a person's behalf. See
`verification.md` and `AI_USAGE.md`.

## Final QA Checklist

- [ ] Every requirement row has reproducible evidence and correct status.
- [ ] All four journey checkpoints are human-approved.
- [ ] Full adversarial review findings are resolved.
- [ ] `./scripts/verify full` passes on the intended submission commit.
- [ ] Core browser evidence exists for all four journeys.
- [ ] Auth, navigation, stale state, errors, and regressions were cross-checked.
- [ ] Console and network errors were reviewed.
- [ ] Accessibility and responsive layouts were spot-checked at recorded viewports.
- [ ] API mock behavior matches `openapi.yaml`.
- [ ] AI records were human-reviewed before publication.
- [ ] Git diff contains no secrets, debug output, generated noise, or unrelated work.
- [ ] A person, not AI, marks final acceptance.
