# Verification Policy

## Canonical Commands

```bash
./scripts/verify setup
./scripts/verify quick
./scripts/verify full
./scripts/verify
```

No argument means `full`. Every verification mode is read-only and compares a
repository content fingerprint before and after execution. A mutation makes
verification fail.

## Modes

- `setup`: required files, document markers and links, risk/approval rules,
  journey categories, review/final-QA sections, pending-record ignore rule,
  Stop/SessionEnd hook wiring, AI disclosure headings, and the four focused
  artifact-contract, exporter, index, and publisher unit-test suites.
- `quick`: `setup`, then `format:check`, `lint`, `typecheck`, and `test` after
  frontend scaffolding.
- `full`: `setup`, `quick`, `build`, and `test:e2e:core` after frontend
  scaffolding.

Before `package.json` exists, frontend stages print
`SKIP frontend not scaffolded`. This certifies workflow setup only. After
`package.json` exists, all six required scripts must exist; absence is failure.

Verification stops on first failure, exits nonzero, prints a reproduction
command, and lists failure classes from `workflow.md`.

## Formatting Mutation Is Separate

`format:check` reports differences and never edits files. Formatting mutation
is separate:

```bash
npm run format
```

Review the resulting diff and run `./scripts/verify quick`. No verify command
may call `npm run format` or another write-mode formatter.

## Test-Level Selection

- Unit: pure validation, transforms, and isolated state.
- Component: labels, disabled states, modal interaction, conditional UI, and
  focused accessibility.
- Integration: API response to view state, router transitions, and feature
  state with controlled external boundaries.
- E2E: real browser behavior crossing authentication, routing, network,
  scrolling, virtualization, or deletion/navigation boundaries.

Choose the lowest level that proves risk reliably. Do not duplicate lower-level
coverage in E2E.

## Core E2E Journeys

Organize by `auth-entry`, `work-overview`, `task-discovery`, and
`task-resolution`, not by page.
Keep at most one representative success path and one critical failure path per journey.
Every E2E names its unique cross-boundary risk. `test:e2e:core` runs only
`@core`; extended, diagnostic,
or browser-compatibility suites use separate explicit commands.

Review slow, flaky, redundant cases for removal or demotion to integration or
component tests.

## Browser Evidence

Record scenario and requirement IDs, commit, route, viewport, preconditions,
actions, expected and actual results, console/network errors, screenshot or
trace, verdict, failure class, correction, and rerun result.

Browser automation failure is `ENVIRONMENT` or `TOOLING`, never product pass.

For `AUTH-07`, focused integration evidence proves that a protected request
sends `Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>` and exercises the human-approved
refresh/expiry behavior. Core E2E covers only a credential or browser-network
boundary that integration evidence cannot prove. The human `auth-entry`
checkpoint reviews both artifacts; authenticated navigation alone is
insufficient.

## Prompt Candidate Verification

Setup verification confirms ignored pending storage, Stop hook wiring, exporter
tests, and reviewed-publication language. The hook creates only structurally
filtered and redacted pending candidates. A person reviews content and sensitive
information in the exact candidate bytes and supplies their
reviewed SHA-256 digest plus both review confirmations to
`scripts/publish-ai-record`. The publisher opens the candidate with no-follow
semantics, requires a regular file, reads it once, rejects a digest mismatch,
and publishes from those bytes.
Published records alone are indexed in `artifacts/index.md`. The explicit
publisher holds the shared index lock and writes the reviewed artifact,
canonical index, and fully regenerated managed `AI_USAGE.md` region in that
order, rolling earlier files back if a later write fails. The region is derived
only from post-publication canonical index filenames, so stale, malformed,
missing, and unindexed links are removed. `SessionEnd` validates and prunes the
index only; it never rewrites `AI_USAGE.md`.
