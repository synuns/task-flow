# Requirements and Golden Journeys

## Source Priority

Use `assignment-original/openapi.yaml` as the API authority and
`assignment-original/requirement.md` for UI and delivery requirements. Record a
`REQUIREMENT` failure and request a human decision when the sources conflict in
a way that changes accepted behavior.

## Status and Evidence Rules

Allowed statuses: `NOT_STARTED`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `AI_VERIFIED`,
`HUMAN_APPROVED`, `BLOCKED`.

AI may set every status except `HUMAN_APPROVED`. Evidence must name a command,
browser record, or review finding. Text claiming a result without reproducible
evidence does not satisfy a checklist row.
Core-journey acceptance, HIGH-risk decisions, exceptions, and final acceptance
are reserved for human owners.

## Golden Journeys

### auth-entry

Requirements: `NAV-02`, `AUTH-01` through `AUTH-07`.

- Preconditions: signed out; sign-in API can return deterministic success and
  error responses.
- Actions: open `/sign-in`; submit invalid fields; submit valid fields against
  error response; dismiss error; submit valid fields against success response;
  inspect authenticated navigation.
- Expected: labels remain usable, invalid values cannot submit, server
  `errorMessage` appears in modal, success establishes authenticated state, and
  navigation switches from sign-in to profile.

### work-overview

Requirements: `SYS-03`, `NAV-01`, `NAV-03`, `DASH-01`, `USER-01`.

- Preconditions: signed in; dashboard and profile APIs return known fixtures.
- Actions: navigate between dashboard, task route, and profile; compare fixture
  data with visible values.
- Expected: route actions and distinct icons remain available, metrics match
  API values, and profile name/memo match API values.

### task-discovery

Requirements: `TASK-LIST-01` through `TASK-LIST-05`.

- Preconditions: signed in; at least two task pages with `hasNext` transition
  from true to false.
- Actions: open `/task`; inspect cards; scroll through viewport; trigger next
  page; continue to terminal page; select a task.
- Expected: correct cards render, DOM stays bounded by virtualization, each
  page is requested once, loading stops at `hasNext: false`, and selection
  navigates to matching detail.

### task-resolution

Requirements: `TASK-DETAIL-01` through `TASK-DETAIL-05`.

- Preconditions: signed in; one existing ID and one missing ID; delete API
  succeeds for existing ID.
- Actions: open existing detail; open missing detail and return; reopen existing
  detail; open delete modal; enter wrong then exact ID; submit.
- Expected: detail fields match API, 404 recovery returns to list, delete submit
  is guarded by exact ID, delete request targets route ID, and success returns
  to `/task`.

## Invariants

- Dashboard and task navigation remain present across routes.
- Authentication state exposes exactly one of sign-in and profile actions.
- UI colors flow through named tokens; Pretendard remains application font.
- Input labels remain associated with controls.
- Invalid sign-in input cannot submit; API errors surface `errorMessage`.
- Protected requests use approved authentication state.
- Virtualized task DOM remains bounded as fetched data grows.
- One task page has at most one in-flight request; `hasNext: false` stops paging.
- Detail 404 always provides list recovery.
- Delete cannot submit without exact ID and success always returns to task list.
- Loading, empty, error, and success states are distinguishable.
- AI evidence never marks `HUMAN_APPROVED`.
- Verification commands never modify repository files.
